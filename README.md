# About

dbretty.Scripts is a repository for scripts, tips and tricks that I have used over the years. **ALL** of the scripts provided here are done so as-is and should be thoroughly reviewed and tested before they are used in production.

## Why

I like to automate things.  It really is that simple, if you have to perform a task more than twice then there is value in automating it not only to reduce human error but also to make your life easier (and repeatable)
